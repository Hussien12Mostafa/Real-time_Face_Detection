# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's DNN module and a pre-trained Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model. The SSD model can detect faces in images and video streams with good accuracy.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`opencv-python`): Used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
- NumPy (`numpy`): Required for numerical computations.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
