Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV
This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's DNN module and a pre-trained Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model. The SSD model can detect faces in images and video streams with good accuracy.

Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (opencv-python): Used for computer vision tasks, including face detection.
NumPy (numpy): Required for numerical computations.
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy

Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the Python script directly.

Download the pre-trained face detection model files from the OpenCV repository:

"deploy.prototxt": Download Link
"res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel": Download Link
Place the downloaded "deploy.prototxt" and "res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel" files in the same directory as the Python script.

How to Use
Run the script in your Python environment:
bash
Copy code
python face_detection.py
The script will access your webcam and start detecting faces in real-time.

Detected faces will be highlighted with green rectangles.

Press 'q' to exit the application.

Configuration
You can adjust the face detection threshold by modifying the confidence variable in the script. The confidence threshold determines the minimum confidence score required to consider a face detection as valid. For example, setting confidence = 0.5 means only detections with a confidence score higher than 0.5 will be displayed.

Acknowledgments
This script uses a pre-trained face detection model from OpenCV.
